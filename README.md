# Seeker-Agent ðŸ”Ž

Searching through websites and blogs for a single piece of reliable information can often be tedious. I mean, who loves scrolling endlessly to find what you need in some corner of a 7 year old webpage. Ever wished for Large Language Models to get this done for you?

That's exactly what this project brings, the power of Google Search, now with the same model behind ChatGPT. With the **Seeker Agent**, now you can simply upload your data as a `.csv` file or connect your Google Sheet, ask a question about your data, sit back and let **Seeker Agent** do the heavylifting for you. Several minutes of tiring Web Search, done in a minute (that's faster than your noodles get prepared in!), but that's not all. With a single click, you can update all of the new found information from the web, back to your data file. It's really that simple.

### Getting Started ðŸš€

If you have been thinking that to have access to such ease comes with a painful setup, you would be mistaken. Setting up **Seeker Agent** is easier than you could imagine!

```
cd your_favourite_repository
git clone https://github.com/debdeepsanyal/Seeker-Agent.git
cd Seeker-Agent
touch .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API KEY>\nSERPAPI_API_KEY=<your SerpAPI API key>" > .env
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```

and, that's all! Executing the above few lines in your terminal opens up a functional and user-friendly interface, which gets all your done in a few clicks. If the Python version on your machine is Python 2, use `pip` in the 6th line instead of `pip3`. Ensure putting in your actual API keys in the 5th line of the terminal commands above! 

### Key Features ðŸ“Œ
   - **No Hassle** - All the task that you want, in single clicks. No squinting of eyes around the screen to find the option which gets your work done, it's easier than you think.

   - **Multi Query** - Want to query for all the items in your column? No need to name them all, just swap in the name of a particular element with `{placeholder}`. The software will automatically generalise your query to all the elements present in your chosen column.

   - **In a blink** - Go from opening the interface to having the search results incorporated in your data (be it your `.csv` file on your local machine or a Google Sheet) in less than 3 minutes! Thanks to multiple efficacies in code to reduce redundant API calls, it's all a breeze.

   - **Search Enhancement** - Google Search is actually quite an art, and you might not always be in the mood to brainstorm about what keywords to include in your query to enhance your search. No worries, we do that for you. A dedicated prompt enhancement engine analyses your prompt and modifies it to include keywords which yield better search results.

   - **Furnished Results** - We don't leave your results half-baked. Once you have your search results, you can have it incorporated to your original file with just a single click. Your Google Sheet would magically have these new columns, and you can have an updated `.csv` file ready for download.

### Usage Notes ðŸš¨
Due to some API restrictions, we (unfortunately) have to limit some of the utilities. The column of the file you are uploading, be it your `.csv` file or the Google Sheet, should have <= **5** unique values. Since we have to perform a Web Search for each of the values, we are limitting the same. The software can automatically detect and will notify you if your chosen column has more than the allowed number of unique values.

If you wish to connect to your Google Sheets, you need to have a `JSON keyfile`, which is required in order to establish the connection. The easiest way to get it done is follow the steps as [instructed by Google](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started). Note that you must be creating a `Service Account`, and once you are done creating the same and enabling the API for Google Sheets (all of this is documented in the aforementioned link), in the 5th step of the process, you will head to the **Credentials** page, where you will find your account under `Service Accounts`. Click on the same, and you will land at a `Trial` page. Click on the `KEYS` tab above, click on `ADD KEY`, `Create new key`, and then `JSON`. That's all! This is the JSON file that you need to upload to the software while establishing the connection. 

Also ensure that before sharing the link to your Google Sheet, you have shared your Google Sheet with the `Service Account` you created (it will be something in the form of `some-name.gserviceaccount.com`), and add this account as the **Editor** to your Google Sheet. Once you have set this up, you're all set!

Small tip! In 1 out of 20 cases, there might be some issue from the API's end. Don't fret! Just run the application once again the same way you did, and it'll work just like a charm.
